## How it works
This simple schematic takes the input of either input 0 or input 1 and outputs a signal. Only input 0 or 1 need to be on to output a signal.
If both input 0 and input 1 are on, it will still output a signal. This signal is what turns on the LED. 

## How to test
Turn on the power for either input 0 or input 1 in order to test. The LED should light up with either input being on and will work with both
inputs powered on at the same time.
